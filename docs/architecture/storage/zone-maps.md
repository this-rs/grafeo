# Zone Maps

Zone maps store statistics about data chunks to enable data skipping.

## Why Zone Maps in a Graph Database?

Graph databases still need property filtering (`WHERE n.age > 30`). When properties are stored in columnar chunks, zone maps let the engine skip entire chunks whose min/max range doesn't overlap the filter predicate. This is especially effective for sorted or clustered properties.

## What Zone Maps Store

| Statistic | Purpose |
| --------- | ------- |
| Min value | Skip chunks where max < filter value |
| Max value | Skip chunks where min > filter value |
| Null count | Skip chunks with no nulls for IS NULL |
| Distinct estimate | Cardinality estimation |
| Bloom filter | Point lookups |

## Example

```text
Query: WHERE age > 50

Chunk 0: min=20, max=45  -> SKIP (max < 50)
Chunk 1: min=30, max=60  -> SCAN (range overlaps)
Chunk 2: min=55, max=80  -> SCAN (range overlaps)
Chunk 3: min=18, max=35  -> SKIP (max < 50)
```

## Predicate Support

| Predicate | Zone Map Check |
| --------- | -------------- |
| `x = v` | min <= v <= max |
| `x > v` | max > v |
| `x < v` | min < v |
| `x >= v` | max >= v |
| `x <= v` | min <= v |
| `x IS NULL` | null_count > 0 |
| `x IN (...)` | bloom filter check |
