# GQL Query Language

GQL (Graph Query Language) is the ISO standard for querying property graphs (ISO/IEC 39075). Obrain implements GQL as its primary query language.

## Overview

GQL uses pattern matching to query and manipulate graph data. The syntax is very similar to Cypher.

## Quick Reference

| Operation | Syntax |
|-----------|--------|
| Match nodes | `MATCH (n:Label)` |
| Match edges | `MATCH (a)-[:TYPE]->(b)` |
| Filter | `WHERE n.property > value` |
| Return | `RETURN n.property` |
| Create | `INSERT (:Label {prop: value})` |
| Update | `SET n.property = value` |
| Delete | `DELETE n` / `DETACH DELETE n` |
| Conditional | `CASE WHEN ... THEN ... END` |
| Cast | `CAST(expr AS type)` |
| Unwind list | `UNWIND [1, 2, 3] AS x` |
| For loop | `FOR x IN $items` |
| Combine queries | `... UNION ALL ...` |
| Call procedure | `CALL name(args) YIELD field` |
| Call subquery | `CALL { MATCH ... RETURN ... }` |
| Create type | `CREATE NODE TYPE Name (...)` |
| Create index | `CREATE INDEX FOR (n:Label) ON (n.prop)` |
| Transaction | `START TRANSACTION READ ONLY` |
