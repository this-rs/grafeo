# GQL Query Language

GQL (Graph Query Language) is the ISO standard for querying property graphs (ISO/IEC 39075). Grafeo implements GQL as its primary query language.

## Overview

GQL uses pattern matching to query and manipulate graph data. If you're familiar with Cypher, you'll find GQL very similar.

## Quick Reference

| Operation | Syntax |
|-----------|--------|
| Match nodes | `MATCH (n:Label)` |
| Match edges | `MATCH (a)-[:TYPE]->(b)` |
| Filter | `WHERE n.property > value` |
| Return | `RETURN n.property` |
| Create | `INSERT (:Label {prop: value})` |
| Update | `SET n.property = value` |
| Delete | `DELETE n` |
| Call procedure | `CALL grafeo.pagerank() YIELD score` |
